# wrike-ist

A GitHub action to make using wrike as a task management tool easier. It does some of the convenient things GitHub does for Issues:

* link pull request to wrike task when the pull request links to the task
* merging a pull request marks the linked task as completed automatically

## Pull requests

This Action recognizes that a pull request links to a wrike task, if there is a wrike permalink pointing to a task in the pull request description. It will then post a comment to the task with a link to the pull request, and mark the task as completed when the pull request is merged.

### Example:

```markdown
## Task
https://www.wrike.com/open.htm?id=696166643

## What
Abstracted common functionality into a new interface

## How
* implemented new interface
* changed all callsites to use interface
* added generated tests
```

### How to find task permalink

## Setup

Here's a sample workflow:

```yaml
name: 'Update wrike'

on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - closed # for closing tasks on merge
      - edited # link in description might be updated
      - opened # yay new pr
      - reopened # someone must've whoops'ed a pr
      # - synchronize # new commit to pr

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: valerauko/wrike-ist@v1
        env:
          WRIKE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.WRIKE_TOKEN }}
```

### wrike token

Currently this action needs a permanent token as it does not support the wrike OAuth workflow. You can issue one [from the Apps & Integrations menu](https://help.wrike.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/211849065-Get-Started-with-Wrike-s-API).

Once you have a token, add it to your repository at Settings > Secrets.

### Inputs

Optionally you can specify (by name) what status you'd want to move the linked task to.

#### `merged`

Specifies the status to move the task to when the linked PR is merged.

If not specified or not found, falls back to the first Completed status in your workflow.

#### `closed`

Specifies the status to move the task to when the linked PR is closed without merging.

If not specified or not found, falls back to the first Cancelled status in your workflow.

## Development

```shell
alias yarn="docker-compose run --rm dev yarn"
```

The development environment is dockerized so you don't need npm or Java installed locally.

0. clone the source code
0. install JS dependencies with `yarn`
0. apply your changes
0. lint it with `yarn lint`

### Testing

Push to see how Github likes it (set up Github actions in your repo to have it run on a feature/branch).

### Cleaning up

* `yarn clean`
* `yarn hard-reset`
